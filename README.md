# dotFiles
These are my dotFiles as of 2/5/2016. This is a backup for my purposes.

##The files.
The tmux theme was taken from [here](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) with some added customizations by myself which is the reason I'm saving it. I've also cobbled together a custom .bashrc file with some neato global aliases for printing everything `system out` in color as well as making some shortcuts for myself.

The rest of the files in this repo are just backups for me which I am unsure I will need but I figure I should put them somewhere anyhow.
